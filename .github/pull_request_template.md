## Validation

<!-- Check only what you personally ran or manually verified. Treat unchecked items as explicit TODOs. -->

- [ ] Matching validation command passes locally (for example `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm check:architecture`, `pnpm check:docs`, or full `pnpm check` when warranted)
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes locally before PR push/handoff, including the unused-code check
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` passes locally
- [ ] `pnpm build` passes locally
- [ ] `pnpm check:architecture` passes locally
- [ ] `pnpm check:docs` passes locally
- [ ] `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --workspace` passes locally
- [ ] Rust clippy/tests were run for Rust behavior changes
- [ ] Browser or Tauri app manual verification completed
- [ ] Browser screenshot/recording evidence added when UI/browser state is the claim
- [ ] Remote runtime smoke checked when relevant

### Manual verification notes

<!-- Describe exactly what you tested in a real browser/app/runtime, step by step. If an AI agent filled this out, verify it yourself before ticking boxes. -->

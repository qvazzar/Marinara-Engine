## What changed

<!-- List the key changes in this PR. -->

## Refactor impact

Primary owner:

<!-- Examples: app shell, catalog, chat mode, roleplay mode, game mode, runtime generation, world-state, shared API, engine generation, Rust storage, imports, remote runtime. -->

Impact areas reviewed:

-

Boundary notes:

<!-- Note engine/shared-api/feature/Rust/remote-runtime boundaries. Say "none" only if you checked. -->

-

Pressure points touched:

<!-- Mention ModeSurface, GameSurface, shared mode UI, src-tauri/src/lib.rs command registration, or import modules if touched. -->

-

## Validation

<!-- Check only what you personally ran or manually verified. Treat unchecked items as explicit TODOs. -->
<!-- Do not submit *.test.ts or *.test.tsx files as PR proof; cite existing checks, command output, app/browser/Tauri verification, or manual notes instead. -->

- [ ] Matching validation command passes locally (for example `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm check:architecture`, `pnpm check:docs`, or full `pnpm check` when warranted)
- [ ] Full `pnpm check` passes before PR push/handoff
- [ ] Human/manual validation completed by contributor or reviewer

### Manual verification notes

<!-- Describe exact commands and manual steps, including typecheck/build/docs/architecture/Rust/browser/remote-runtime checks when they apply. If an AI agent filled this out, verify it yourself before ticking boxes. -->
